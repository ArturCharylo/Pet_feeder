# 📦 Pet_feeder

A simple **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that allows users to mark the days they fed their pets and receive notifications if they forget.

🟢 [Live App on Vercel](https://pet-feeder-five.vercel.app/)

This app is serverless — all data is stored locally in the browser. It can be downloaded as a PWA on any device. Notifications will remind you when you're about to miss a feeding.

> ⚠️ Notifications require the browser tab to be open or the app to run in the background.
